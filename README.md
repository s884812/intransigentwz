# intransigentwz
*.wz files for the IntransigentMS Maplestory private server.


Some *.wz editing tools exist here: https://github.com/NoetherEmmy/intransigentms-tools
    
+ All of the tools operate on classic XML.

Prefer to "Export as Classic XML," make changes if needed, and import into the desired *.wz file when making large, crucial changes (like importing maps) or whenever backporting from post-bb instead of copying and pasting nodes within the *.wz editor.
